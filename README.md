"Neighborhood Navigator" is a web-based application that enables users to plot and compare real estate data over time.

In addition, because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, I added a feature that plots COVID-19 cases by county alongside the real estate data.

This project is built using SQL, JavaScript, Python, and CSS.


The data is imported from:
* Zillow (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)
* New York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
